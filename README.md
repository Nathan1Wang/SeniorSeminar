This program is an algorithm to sort students based on preferences into 5 sessions. There are 18 sessions and each session can run twice ( with a 16 person max) however there are only 5 times slots with 5 sessions each (25 total runs). This information is taken from a csv imported file. The students are first sorted through and counted to see how many times each session is picked. Then, the arraylist is sorted. Then, A schedule is made based on popularity (with each session running once first). The schedule is printed. This part works. 
Then, the student are put into their 5 sessions, if a session is full, they will be assigned a random, open session. The program first looks for another session (a second run). This sorting is not optimal but I could not figure out my original plan which was to assign 0's in place of the array for sessions that already had a pick. This sorting also does not work yet however I have run out of time (took longer than expected). Specifically, the code does not recognize my methods getIndex, sesExists, getIndex2 with the error symbol not found. Currently trying to resolve issue.
Update (4/14): code compiles, sending an error but not sure where, plan to resolve over the weekend
